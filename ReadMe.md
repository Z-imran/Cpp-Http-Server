# HTTP Server
- This project is a build of a http server in C++. We start of with building a basic server and creating the corresponding socket, binding it to ht eport, and marking it for listening. We then wait for a client to connect after which we parse the request, build a response adn send it back to the client which then closes the connection after receiving the response. 

### Goals
- The goal of the project is to develop a deeper understanding of how servers actually work while also developing a deeper understanding of how C++ works. 
- Familiarize myself with a deeper understanding of internet sockets, and handling requests. 
- Use asynchronous programming to be able to handle multiple client requests at once. 
- Its also just a cool project. 

### Technologies Used
- Cmake (build system)
- C++17
- POSIX Sockets
